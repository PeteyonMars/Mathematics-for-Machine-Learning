# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning
A project for a machine learning course I took in Fall 2025; used R for Principal Component Analysis, clustering (k-means, GMM), optimization (elbow plot), and validation (Silhouette score).

# Contents
1. .Rmd with the code itself.
2. Write-up created as a group. Appendix of Figure outputs from .Rmd at the end.
3. Dataset pulled from UCI Repository

# Note
If you want to run the codes yourself you need to redefine the directory on .Rmd / line 47.
Also, the Figures labeled in .Rmd refer to the Figures in the Appendix section of the .Pdf write-up attached.
