# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning
A project for a machine learning course I took in Fall 2025; used Principal Component Analysis, clustering (k-means, GMM), optimization (elbow plot), and validation (Silhouette score).

# Contents
1. .html with the code chunks, outputs loaded.
2. .Rmd with the code itself.
3. Write-up created as a group.
